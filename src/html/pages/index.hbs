<p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
Not a footprint to be seen.<br>
A kingdom of isolation,<br>
and it looks like I'm the <br>
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
Couldn't keep it in;<br>
Heaven knows I've tried<br>

Don't let them in,<br>
don't let them see<br>
Be the good girl you always have to be<br>
Conceal, don't feel,<br>
don't let them know<br>
Well now they know<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Can't hold it back anymore<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
Turn away and slam the door<br>
I don't care<br>
what they're going to say<br>
Let the storm rage on.<br>
The cold never bothered me anyway<br>
<br>
It's funny how some distance<br>
Makes everything seem small<br>
And the fears that once controlled me<br>
Can't get to me at all<br>
<br>
It's time to see what I can do<br>
To test the limits and break through<br>
No right, no wrong, no rules for me,<br>
I'm free!<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
I am one with the wind and sky<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
You'll never see me cry<br>
Here I stand<br>
And here I'll stay<br>
Let the storm rage on<br>
<br>
My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>
I'm never going back, the past is in the past<br>
<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br>
Let it go, let it go<br>
That perfect girl is gone<br>
Here I stand<br>
In the light of day<br>
Let the storm rage on
